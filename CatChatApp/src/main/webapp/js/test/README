Using QUnit for JavaScript testing, must run via Server
same origin policy

To run
------
Create a database named CatChat (username: app, password: app)

Run the program and register 2 unique users. Login both. (This isn't done
automatially as you register a user, so you must login both users manually)

Make sure that the getOnlineUsers() is working:
CatChatApp > RESTful Web Services > UserResource > HTTP Method > getOnlineUsers() (right-click > Test Resource Uri)
We've had unexplainable errors sometimes. So you must restart Netbeans until
it actually works. We're sorry about the difficulty.

Mark tests.html, right click > Run File
